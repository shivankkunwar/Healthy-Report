# Health Report Application

## Overview

The Health Report Application is a web-based platform that allows users to report injuries and health-related incidents. It consists of two main components: a front-end built with React and a back-end built with Express.js and MongoDB. Users can submit injury reports, view their submitted reports, and sort reports based on various criteria. The application also utilizes Auth0 for user authentication.
